With GraphMaker 2.0 you can resolve this problem: to make a monthly
bar or line graph. With the script you can make it on the fly or use cron to
upgrade it every day.
Now you can make monthly graphs via Internet at 
http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/3469 or you can install it on your
server so that your users can make monthly graphs in your Intranet.

For the script I use perl5.00x (http://www.perl.com) and GD.pm library
(http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/GD.html)
For the cgi-bin I use perl5.00x, GD.pm, and cgi-lib.pl
(http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/cgi-lib/) or CGI.pm 
(http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/) with cgi-lib.pl support

Read the INSTALL.CGI file if you want to install the tool on your Web.
Read the INSTALL file if you want to use the tool in standalone mode.
In docs directory tou can find other documentation.
Enjoy it!

Send me your suggestions.
