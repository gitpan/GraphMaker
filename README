Graph Maker 1.0

My problem was: I wanted to generate simple graphs (in x the days and in y
the data) to use in html documents (gif format).
Why did I have to use gnuplot and then to convert the output format in gif?
So I try to make a simple script PERL that use GD.pm library to generate gif.

At the moment if you want change the default parameters you have to edit 
graphmaker.pl and change the values in the part "Configure the value of the
variables"

Send me your observations, patches, ...
