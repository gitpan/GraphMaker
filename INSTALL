This simple tool is compose of these files
graphmaker.pl				the tool
graphmaker.dat				the default data input

1) Check if you have PERL. You can find it at http://www.perl.com

2) Check if you have GD.pm (A graphics library for fast GIF creation in perl).
   You can find it at http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/GD.html

3) Control the path of your perl installation. The default in graphmaker.pl is
   #!/usr/local/bin/perl -Tw

4) At the moment if you want change the default parameters you have to edit 
   graphmaker.pl and change the values in the part "Configure the value of the
   variables"

I don't test this simple tool with PERL version 4. I hope it works.
